# Nepali Data Sources

A list of data sources for Nepal related data. I could not find a collection of these anywhere so I made one for my own use. Later, I saw someone asking for some of these on Reddit, so I released this collection hoping that it would be useful/helpful to others. 

If you'd like to contribute, then please add your sources and the details following the format, and then you may send a pull request. Most of the data is in PDF, so you will need to use tools like [Tabula](http://tabula.technology/) to get the data in a usable format for data analysis, visualization, or for any other purposes.
